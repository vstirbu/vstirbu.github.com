[Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) is an awesome build system that helps with automating common tasks during development. Despite its benefits, there are times when the standard way of running the tasks, via the command line interface, is not enough and you would want to run it programmatically... So, this rises the question _where is the Gulp API?_

Lets consider that we have the following gulp setup:

{% highlight javascript %}
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('dependency', function () {
  // do something before trigger
});

gulp.task('trigger', ['dependency'], function () {
  // do something
});
{% endhighlight %}

The most interesting features when building a front end, which uses gulp programmatically, is to be aware of the task execution state. A closer look at the [source](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/index.js#L12) reveals that under the hood a gulp object is just an [orchestrator](https://github.com/robrich/orchestrator), and all the orchestrator's goodies are directly available for gulp as well. Therefore, gulp emits events when starting a task sequence, and on the beginning and end of each task in the respective sequence:

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.on('start', function (e) {
  // task sequence started
  console.log(e);
});

gulp.on('task_start', function(e) {
  // task started
  console.log(e);
});

gulp.on('task_stop', function (e) {
  // task ended
  console.log(e);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Now with the events registered we can run the `trigger` task as follows:

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.start('trigger');
{% endhighlight %}

The result contains the sequence of tasks as well as the progress information including the time required to run each task:

{% highlight bash %}
{ message: 'seq: dependency,trigger' }
{ task: 'dependency', message: 'dependency started' }
{ task: 'dependency',
  message: 'dependency sync',
  duration: 0.000072076,
  hrDuration: [ 0, 72076 ] }
{ task: 'trigger', message: 'trigger started' }
{ task: 'trigger',
  message: 'trigger sync',
  duration: 0.000020074,
  hrDuration: [ 0, 20074 ] }
{% endhighlight %}

So, the answer to _where is the Gulp API?_ is... __under the hood, in [orchestrator](https://github.com/robrich/orchestrator)__.
