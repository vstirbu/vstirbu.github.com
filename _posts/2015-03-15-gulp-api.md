[Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) is an awesome build system that helps with automating common [tasks](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md) during development. Despite the benefits, there are times when the standard way of running the tasks, via the [command line interface](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/CLI.md), is not enough and you would want to embed gulp in another application and run the tasks programmatically... So, this raises the question _where is the Gulp API?_ 

Lets consider that we have the following gulp setup:

{% highlight javascript %}
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('dependency', function () {
  // do something before trigger
});

gulp.task('trigger', ['dependency'], function () {
  // do something
});
{% endhighlight %}

The most interesting features when building a front end, which uses gulp programmatically, is to be aware of the task execution state. A closer look at the [source](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/index.js#L12) reveals that under the hood a gulp object is just an [orchestrator](https://github.com/robrich/orchestrator), and all the orchestrator's goodies are directly available to gulp as well. Therefore, gulp emits events when starting a task sequence, and on the beginning and end of each task in the respective sequence:

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.on('start', function (e) {
  // task sequence started
  console.log(e);
});

gulp.on('task_start', function(e) {
  // task started
  console.log(e);
});

gulp.on('task_stop', function (e) {
  // task ended
  console.log(e);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Now with the events registered we can run the `trigger` task as follows:

{% highlight javascript %}
gulp.start('trigger');
{% endhighlight %}

The result contains the sequence of tasks as well as the progress information including the time required to run each task:

{% highlight bash %}
{ message: 'seq: dependency,trigger' }
{ task: 'dependency', message: 'dependency started' }
{ task: 'dependency',
  message: 'dependency sync',
  duration: 0.000072076,
  hrDuration: [ 0, 72076 ] }
{ task: 'trigger', message: 'trigger started' }
{ task: 'trigger',
  message: 'trigger sync',
  duration: 0.000020074,
  hrDuration: [ 0, 20074 ] }
{% endhighlight %}

So, the answer to _where is the Gulp API?_ is... __under the hood, in [orchestrator](https://github.com/robrich/orchestrator)__.
