description: An approach is provided for generating a virtual environment for controlling one or more electronic devices. A mapping platform causes, at least in part, a rendering of a user interface depicting a virtual environment comprising one or more representations of one or more devices, one or more accessory devices associated with the one or more devices, or a combination thereof. The mapping platform then determines one or more interactions with the user interface, the virtual environment, the one or more representations, or a combination thereof. Further, the mapping platform processes and/or facilitates a processing of the one or more interactions to cause, at least in part, a controlling of the one or more devices, the one or more accessory devices, or a combination thereof.
