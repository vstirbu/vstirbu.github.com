description: The invention relates to a method of arranging communication in a local area networking system comprising a first device, a second device and an intermediate node for arranging data transmission between the first device and the second device. The second device is arranged to multicast and/or broadcast messages to devices in the system. The transmission of multicast and/or broadcast messages to the first device is prevented by the interworking means.
