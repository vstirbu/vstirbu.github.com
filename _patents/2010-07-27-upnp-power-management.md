description: A mobile terminal includes a processor capable of operating a link manager. The link manager is capable of at least partially operating a wireless connection between the terminal and an access point in an active mode, where the access point is coupled to a network. The link manager is also capable of transitioning the connection from the active mode to a standby mode or hibernate mode. In this regard, transitioning the connection includes entering the mobile terminal in a power-saving mode of a bearer of the connection, such as a Bluetooth power-saving mode, and directing the access point to reduce traffic flowing from the network across the connection to the mobile terminal when the mobile terminal is otherwise capable of receiving the traffic.
