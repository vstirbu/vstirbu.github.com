description: A user equipment (UE) device (11) including a mobile terminal (MT) (11b 11b') coupled to a terminal equipment (TE) device (11a) including an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) proxy adjunct (P+) for use by the TE (11a) in making multimedia service requests for IP communications with a desired end-to-end QoS, the end-to-end including the local connection and a network supporting QoS, e.g. an UMTS network (12) having as an extension of its packet-switched core network (12b) an IMS (12c) providing multimedia services with selected QoS. The IMS proxy adjunct (P+) is implemented to make extensions to messages according to any protocol providing a session description protocol (SDP) component, such as SIP or RTSP, so as to ensure the selected QoS. In addition, a mechanism is provided by which the MT (11b') informs the IMS (12c) when it has IMS proxy capabilities.
