description: A network entity for providing QoS during remote access to a PnP network includes a QoS manager for receiving in-band device capabilities of a PnP-enabled in-band correspondent and a PnP-enabled out-of-band remote node, the remote node being in communication with the PnP network over a secure tunnel. As presented, the in-band device capabilities of the correspondent node are at least partially based on an in-band network interface of the correspondent node. The in-band device capabilities of the remote node, however, comprise capabilities having been mapped from out-of-band device capabilities, where those out-of-band device capabilities are at least partially based on an out-of-band network interface of the remote node. The QoS manager is further adapted to configure the correspondent and remote nodes for a desired in-band QoS based on the QoS policy and respective device capabilities.
