description: A mobile device is coupled to an ad-hoc, peer-to-peer local area network via a public network. A secure data connection is created between the mobile device and an access point of the local area network so that the mobile device operates in an address space of the local network. A proxy for the mobile device is operated on the local network. The proxy maintains one or more state variables related to operation of the mobile device on the local network. The proxy simulates a reduced power mode of the mobile device on the local network for purposes of shaping traffic over the secure data connection and provides the state variables to entities of the local network on behalf of the mobile device.
