description: This invention describes a method for expanding universal plug and play capabilities in a power constrained environment thus facilitating communication between two terminals with universal plug and play (UPnP) application capabilities, wherein one of the terminals is in a sleeping mode. The present invention can be applied (but not be limited) to mobile terminals, wireless devices, portable devices, mobile communication devices, mobile phones, etc. The invention describes a mechanism in which the UPnP application dynamically instructs the TCP/IP stack to tune-up its parameters so that it can tolerate longer delays and timeouts, due to the fact that it operates in a power constrained UPnP environment.
