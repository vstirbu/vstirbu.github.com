description: Modifying remote service discovery based on presence involves identifying service discovery data using ad-hoc, peer-to-peer, service discovery protocols of a local network. The service discovery data is aggregated via an entity of the local network. Presence data associated with a remote device located outside of the local network is identified and the aggregated service discovery data is altered based on the presence data. The altered aggregated service discovery data is made available to the remote device using out-of-band communications. The out-of-band communications are different from the service discovery protocols of the local network.
