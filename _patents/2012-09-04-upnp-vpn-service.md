description: A system and method for creating a virtual private network through a VPN gateway configuration service. The VPN gateway configuration service inherits UPnP zero-configuration characteristics and also provides an interface for configuring the VPN gateway that enables the configuration of any VPN gateway device, regardless of manufacturer. Additionally, the device control protocol defined by the VPN gateway configuration service can provide client provisioning, as well as enabling the configuration of gateway-to-gateway virtual private networks.
