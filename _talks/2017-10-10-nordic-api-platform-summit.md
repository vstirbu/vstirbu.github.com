[Patient Care](http://solutions.health.nokia.com/patient-care) is a new health solution offered by Nokia that enables remote monitoring of patients. Biomedical signals collected via smart devices are analysed in the cloud and the results are presented to medical professionals.

The session will present our methodology of developing microservices that make the Patient Care backend. We pay special attention on testing during the various phases of the development process, and ending with deployment to production, aiming at ensuring that resulting software is compliant with relevant medical software regulations and standards, such as HIPAA or [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html) respectively.
