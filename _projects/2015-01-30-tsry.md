Established in 2004, Tampereen Suomi-Romania yhdistys ry (TSRY) is an independent organization promoting Romanian culture and language in Finland. Our work relies on the enthusiasm of our team of volunteers and in addition to the cultural activities, TSRY also plays an active part in the social life of the Romanian Diaspora in Finland. Our members are mainly Finnish and Romanian, but we welcome people from all backgrounds with an open heart.
