description: We designed a solution for scalable and adaptive sharing of desktop and mobile applications, using a lightweight network-based system compliant with the REST architectural style. The system delivers consistency of the rendered user interfaces with the state of the application logic using a stateless networking substrate. We describe the architecture focusing on how to model the user interfaces as a set of web resources. Then, we present the prototype that implements the functionality as an extension of the Qt framework, which works with different Qt-based user interface toolkits. Finally, we present a multi-display and multi-user Texas Holdâ€™em application that shows how the system is used in practice.
