description: Researchers from Nokia propose a Web-based framework that applies a resource-based HTTP style called Representational State Transfer (REST) to enable smart spaces to support pervasive applications in various devices. Mobile devices are evolving into hubs of content and context information. Therefore, our work focuses on pervasive applications in smart spaces that use locally available connectivity and device discovery. This approach allows, for example, sharing content and offering services locally with direct connections between devices. Although many research projects have shown the potential of such applications, the results of this research haven't yet become widely deployed.
